                            Ultra Trivia is a simple Discord trivia bot written in Python made to run interactive trivia games out of a single Discord channel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I adapted the idea of Ultra Trivia from watching a YouTube trivia game similar to it played entirely in one Discord text channel (with voice alongside to explain rules and read questions).
                            It was a great format, but took a long time to run and manage, and everyone's answers were public (although the intent was to share answers all at once).
                            I wanted to try this sort of game out myself but see what sort of improvements could be made to the format in the process.

                        <p>
                            A game of Ultra Trivia needs a "quiz-master" to run it - one person who sets up each question and reveals answers.
                            To do this, the bot provides a variety of slash-commands for expected functionality.
                            Setting up a question requires having a document of questions in a pre-defined format to copy-paste directly into the bot's question form; 
                            this makes initial setup slightly challenging but allows for modular "question sheets" to be created.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once the question is posted to the chat by the Ultra Trivia bot, buttons are embedded alongside the message so that each player can provide their own answer.
                            These answers are kept hidden until the answer is revealed (or if the quiz-master wants to show what everyone guessed before the correct answer is shown).
                            The capability to use buttons in this manner was one of the reasons I created the Ultra Trivia bot: to see what modern capabilities bots had.   
                        </p>

                            Discord has definitely been busy adding features since I finished the Ultra Trivia bot enough to do my first tests.
                            Since 2022, Discord has introduced "activities" - multiplayer games built directly into the app designed to be played solo or with friends.
                            The Discord Activity API is public now, and any developer can create and run their own activities using it, albeit only in small servers unless approved.
                            This is a great incentive to see how much <em>more</em> I can expand Ultra Trivia's automation. If possible, I could streamline it all, so no quiz master is required!
