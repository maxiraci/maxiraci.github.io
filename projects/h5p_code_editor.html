                            <a target="_blank" href="https://h5p.org/">H5P</a> is a project designed to create and facilitate modular interactive HTML5 browser content. 
                            This content can then be used and reused in content management systems (CMS) for a variety of reasons, including educational.

                            I created a code editor module for H5P in 2021 as part of a university project. 
                            The editor itself was not written from scratch by me - I adapted the open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://codemirror.net/3/">CodeMirror</a> framework,
                            since it was the best for the use case I had and permissible enough in its license for the project.

                            As part of the university project that resulted in this editor, I wrote an academic paper describing 
                            the process of its creation, from initial designs to testing and rapid iteration.
                            I went into detail about researching online web-based open-source code editors. Many out there exist, including (todo:),
                            but CodeMirror worked the best for the project.

                            I utilised various technologies in order to test the H5P editor in a mock environment during testing.
                            I spun up a CMS of my own for development: an instance of Drupal via Docker. 
                            This environment helped me find bugs before committing any code to the project repository, since it made
                            any errors more reproducible at runtime and didn't lead to unexpected variances.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fundamentals of an H5P module come down to a bundle of minified JavaScript and HTML utilising JQuery
                            for event handling and setup. Configuring the module itself also involved changing a bunch of JSON 
                            configuration files to determine what options would display on the module to the user (e.g. indent and programming language)
