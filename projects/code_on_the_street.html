                        <p>
                            "Code on the Street" is a full-stack software project designed to compare programming languages based on their
                            presence on Stack Overflow. It uses metrics such as upvote count, percentage of answered questions, and site presence
                            to give a score to each language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To create this project, I used the pandas and StackAPI Python modules for querying and processing data, 
                            the Flask Python module to spin up a web back-end, and the c3.js frontend library to render charts. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project is not designed to gauge <em>objectively</em> which programming language is best, 
                            but I completely endorse using this tool as evidence in the never-ending debate everyone has about which language to use.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The backend code queried the Stack Overflow API for up to 300 random posts at a time with the queried tag.
                            When returned, this data would contain a variety of information about the post.
                            This included post title and body content, the score of the question (upvotes and downvotes), 
                            and all the other tags associated with the post (which helps determine common tags used alongside the queried one).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Stack Overflow API has pretty strict rate limits when querying this much data. 
                            To avoid querying the API where possible, I preloaded the top 5000 questions from the top 10 most popular tags on StackOverflow.
                            This helped keep response times low when querying about these languages.

                            Half of the score for a tag comes from the ratio of answered to unanswered questions with that tag;
                            after all, that's what Stack Overflow is all about. I figured putting that info front and center would be a good indication,
                            but it also means tags with fewer questions end up getting an inherent advantage because it's easier to get a higher percentage. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The inclusion of "code examples" as a scoring metric was because I figured it made for better questions. 
                            Questions with examples of what the asker is intending to do are considered better practise in Stack Overflow.
                            That being said, I understand some tags would not use code as often (e.g. codeless languages, cloud services),
                            so I only made it count for 1 mark out of 10.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I added the "Site Presence" score metric based on how common the tag is. This has some benefits and drawbacks.
                            Generally, a question that has more presence will be answered more readily, whether or not the answer is marked as such.
                            However, languages that have less data (i.e. less common on Stack Overflow) shouldn't necessarily be immediately and harshly marked down,
                            as they could just be new or not commonly used in favour of other tags (e.g. <code>python2.x</code> is used less than <code>python</code>).
                            I similarly opted to just have it count for only 1 mark out of 10 for the final score.
