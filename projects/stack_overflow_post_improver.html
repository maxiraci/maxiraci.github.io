                            The popular documentation question-and-answer site Stack Overflow helps developers get quick answers to common programming questions.
                            They are often very useful but vary in quality, especially with more niche languages or tags. <br />
                            
                            However, posts on Stack Overflow are publicly editable, with users optionally providing descriptive edit messages.
                            These edits could in theory be used to discover common pitfalls in questions and potentially automatically fix them.
                        </p><p>
                            To improve existing future Stack Overflow posts, I developed a prototype model to improve basic post readability using the dataset <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08193" target="_blank">An Annotated Dataset of Stack Overflow Post Edits</a>.<br />
                            This was achieved primarily through use of natural language processing and machine learning, alongside trivial readability improvements. 
                            The resulting program can fix trivial issues such as sentence casing and formatting, and also warns users when often-redundant information is added to posts or documentation.

                            The data was obtained from a prior project aimed to annotate a set of Stack Overflow post edits 
                            by what exact changes were mentioned. Each entry in the dataset included the content "diff" alongside the comment the editor left, which described what they did.

                            As part of research, I went over a subset of the edit data obtained 
                            and checked to see what needed to be looked out for in terms of potential design ideas or issues.
                            I went through each of the edits in this subset and checked to see what exactly was changed and whether it helped the final result.
                            Nearly always, the result was positive (after all, that's the point of an edit!) but I checked to see how exactly it improved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also categorised potentially negative edits that would confuse the machine-learning model; 
                            mainly this came about in the form of hyper-specific or poor-quality edits that wouldn't work well to learn from.

                            The actual program was split into two parts as a prototype: automatic code detection and common phrase removal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Posts on StackOverflow without properly formatted code examples are really hard to read properly, and often get changed to add code tags.
                            I wanted to see how easy this process could be to automate. <br />
                            The automatic code detection was trained on long strings of code of various languages, 
                            alongside with long sections of other text seen on StackOverflow so the model could tell the difference.
                            Once the model was trained, the idea was that it could add code tags (<code>```</code>) into any post.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many Stack Overflow edits are designed to simplify the question, 
                            both for the sake of finding an answer but also for clarity for future viewers. 
                            To this extent, I wanted to find out what the most common "edited out" phrases were, which I achieved using natural language processing.
                            I used the python library <code>nltk</code> to identify phrases commonly used (ngrams) and marked them as sections "to remove" in the final program.
