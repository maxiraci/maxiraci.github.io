                            <cite>vis</cite> is a visualiser created to allow users to upload audio files as videos where embedded audio is not normally supported. 
                            <br />
                            As an example, despite Discord featuring support for embedded audio files on their PC and web platforms for years, it seems they are apathetic about adding
                            mobile support for it, which means most audio can't be played on mobile without downloading the file. 
                            <br />
                            Using <cite>vis</cite> means it plays as a video file instead, which Discord natively supports on all platforms. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A basic visualiser would have worked fine, but had a couple of limitations. Videos of the wrong aspect ratios would suffer when online video players would
                            overlay their video play bar on top; it could also become complicated to use some vertical volume bars. 
                            Various visualisation methods would also encode into a format that didn't work on specific devices; iPhones use a different format encoding of h264 to Android and PC.

                                The main functionality of <cite>vis</cite> is a wrapper for <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a>, a powerful open-source
                                media encoding tool. FFmpeg handles the work, but the complicated part is the parameters to
                                generate the text and the grid behind it, as it is generated at runtime.
