                        <p>
                            Scavenger Showdown is a competitive scavenger hunt game designed for 1-4 players. To win, players must find all the items scattered around the map before everyone else.
                            The game can be played in single-player to go for a record time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created Scavenger Showdown with three others as part of the 2021 <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/" target="_blank">Global Game Jam</a>.
                            The theme for the 2021 GGJ was "Lost and Found".

                            The gameplay of Scavenger Showdown involves finding all 13 items scattered around the map in a random order. 
                            All players must find all 13 items, but the order everyone gets is randomised.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, all objects' positions are placed randomly from a pool of locations, meaning players cannot just memorise the locations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Players also have swords, which they can use in multiplayer to attack others. Each player has three hearts 
                            - if a player loses all their hearts they sit out for 10 seconds and then respawn at the beginning of the stage (while keeping the progress they have).

                            Because of the limited time, I decided against making my own graphics for the game. Instead, I utilised a variety of asset packs, including:
                            <ul>

                            </ul> 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <aside>

                    </aside>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <div class="content">

                            The limitations of the jam format plus working semi-sporadically with three other people meant Scavenger Showdown ended up rather lackluster.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The random generation of the order of finding objects means players' luck completely determines their success. 
                            Some generations could lead to the collection order ping-ponging in location across the map, and others could put them in close proximity. 
                            In the end, this was the biggest factor to its general mediocre feel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The map routing is rather fun, but a lot of the general routes aren't very useful in the end.
                            since the positions of the objects are randomised, you can't even strategically remember the objects' locations before you go anywhere, 
                            instead having to look around haphazardly at the start and just hope you find one of your items soon.
                            As such, despite me putting in various movement options to get around the map quickly, a lot of the gameplay relies on just wandering around and hoping
                            you remember where everything is while looking around and fending off opponents.
                        </p>
