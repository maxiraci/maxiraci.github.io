                            <cite>Built-Up! </cite> is a VR building game about creative construction and coffee-cup relocation. <br />
                            Using simple building blocks and connectors, players create innovative solutions to various problems to knock over coffee cups in various locations. <br />
                            I assisted in creating this game as lead programmer and composer alongside six other developers as part of my <cite>Virtual Reality Design and Development II</cite> course at <cite>The University of Adelaide.</cite>

                            Gameplay in Built-Up! involves knocking over coffee cups placed in increasingly complicated-to-reach positions.
                            The way this is accomplished is with simple building blocks and physics-based connectors, from hinges to glue.

                            I created a hologram spawner which is used in-game to create the building materials. 
                            Originally, the concept was that each player would have a pre-defined set of materials 
                            (from a specific “toolkit” chosen before the game started) that they would use to accomplish the goals. 
                            This feature was eventually scrapped due to two factors;
                            it was hard to construct the sheer number of models required to have multiple sets of building materials, 
                            and also primarily it wasn't very fun to play with a restricted building palette. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The “Object Spawner” is a good solution; it provides a central consistent spawn location for objects that allows players to create as many building materials as they want.

                            The game concept was originally to require a player to support a number of paper coffee cups from falling onto the ground via construction of a coffee table. 
                            This was eventually changed to knocking existing cups over because Unity's inbuilt physics doesn't really play nice with having weight constraints and forces.

                            Given the two scenes I had to work with, I had to come up with interesting missions for each. 
                            I ended up creating 9 missions in total; 4 for the “Living Room” scene and 5 for the “Courtyard” scene. 
                            Each has a unique concept which challenges the player in different ways. 
                            Admittedly, the earlier ones are rather easy; I created them just so the players can get a good feel for the game.

                            The game is quite light-hearted with a simple cartoonish art-style, so I tried to encapsulate that feeling into the music; 
                            the style is relatively upbeat and jovial. Tracks such as "City Life" or "If you Build It.." share this style in a way that I feel 
                            fits the aim of the game quite well. For an ingame change of pace I created the more-subdued "Articulate", which still fits the building theme but as it's less intense it 
                            gives the player room to think and experiment.
                        </p>

                            The tutorial section of <cite>Built-Up!</cite> ended up getting scrapped, but I had created music for it anyway; 
                            "Learn the Ropes" I feel works as a tutorial theme as it's exciting yet mysterious.
