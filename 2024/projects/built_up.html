                            <cite>Built-Up! </cite> is a VR building game about creative construction and coffee-cup relocation. <br />
                            Using simple building blocks and connectors, players create innovative solutions to various problems to knock over coffee cups in various locations. <br />
                            I assisted in creating this game as lead programmer and composer alongside six other developers as part of my <cite>Virtual Reality Design and Development II</cite> course at <cite>The University of Adelaide.</cite>

                            The game is quite light-hearted with a simple cartoonish art-style, so I tried to encapsulate that feeling into the music; 
                            the style is relatively upbeat and jovial. Tracks such as "City Life" or "If you Build It.." share this style in a way that I feel 
                            fits the aim of the game quite well. For an ingame change of pace I created the more-subdued "Articulate", which still fits the building theme but as it's less intense it 
                            gives the player room to think and experiment.
                        </p>

                            The tutorial section of <cite>Built-Up!</cite> ended up getting scrapped, but I had created music for it anyway; 
                            "Learn the Ropes" I feel works as a tutorial theme as it's exciting yet mysterious.
