                        <p>
                            As part of a university assignment I drafted and created a website designed to help with workforce coordination and task management.
                            I also created a backend server for the website using Node.js and Express which stored and processed the data using an SQL database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While most of the actual site content remains placeholder, the project itself was useful for me as my first foray into full-stack web development.

                            I experimented with a variety of features while working on this task management site, including:
                            <ul>
                                <li>logins (using both site-based login and an OAuth2 "Sign in with Google" button)</li>
                                <li>task creation, management, and assigning</li>
                                <li>user-facing availability assignment</li>
                                <li>customisable profiles, with the ability for users to change their own profile picture</li>
                                <li>dark theme, with a clientside toggle</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Availabilities</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            The system was designed first and foremost to be able to allow people to find out who is available to work on what at a specific time.
                            To that end, users were able to add availabilities to their account which would determine when they could work on something.
                            This system was primitive in its initial implementation; if I were to return to this I'd definitely add a way to make an availability repeatable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When assigning a task, a user's availabilities would display to show whether they had the time to work on it. If unavailable or already assigned a task during this time,
                            the user's icon would be grayed out.
