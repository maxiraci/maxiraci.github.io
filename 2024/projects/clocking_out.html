                            Every 10 seconds in this top-down shooter, you'll get one positive and one negative effect from a cycle that you choose beforehand.

                            Before players get to start playing, they have to pick their benefit "cycle" - what benefits and drawbacks they would get every 10 seconds.
                            To start, you had to pick all six from each group - all you could decide was the order to have them apply in, which means you'd have to decide
                            what benefit would outweigh the mandatory drawback you would have for that time. As an example, I saw a lot of players pair the "double damage" 
                            or "double firing speed" benefit with the "cannot move" drawback, as it let them keep enemies off them while they weren't allowed to move.

                            The game progresses through three levels of increasing complexity in both level design and enemy design.
                            At first the player fights small waves of unarmed gears that slowly move towards them, making it relatively easy to fight them,
                            but by the final level the arena turns much more hostile as the enemies have fast-firing deadly projectile weapons.
                            I liked the change in gameplay style this invoked in playtesters as they shifted from guns-blazing running at and around enemies
                            to taking cover and rolling out of the way of danger to get a quick shot in before the enemies could do the same.

                            This was my first attempt at using Godot, and I used the experience to learn how Godot's node structure and functionality worked.
                            I started small with a minimal gameplay loop, as most game jams go: making the character move, making the gun work, adding enemies, then adding a loop of spawning enemies.

                        <p>
                            The unique mechanic of the game (cycling the benefits and drawbacks every 10 seconds) was relatively easy to implement, although coming up with fun drawbacks was difficult
                            (honestly I'm not sure I nailed it - the "cannot move" drawback really sucks to play with, so I have changed it in development versions to a -90% movement speed debuff instead.)

                            I chose to use Godot 4 at the time because the numerous improvements over Godot 3 interested me enough to give it a shot. 
                            Unfortunately the jam was held at a time where Godot 4.0 was still very much in the beta cycle; this led to my game having a 
                            lot of visual glitches and crashes that I couldn't fix without a lot more time than the 72 hours I had.  
                        </p>

                            The in-development gameplay video shown displays some other issues I had - I had to remove dynamic shadows because they were causing crashes.
                            It was unfortunate because it made the game look a lot better.
