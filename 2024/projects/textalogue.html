                        <p>
                            Textalogue is a tool I worked on for the Unity game engine used to create dynamic textboxes and dialogue systems.
                            Using a visually-intuitive node system, no code skills are required to add and modify dialogue quickly and easily.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While making an RPG with dialogue choices, I was unsatisfied with the options I found online,
                            so I followed a tutorial to make a node-based editor that worked directly out of the editor. 
                            After some iteration, I then used that to make dialogue for my game, and it worked successfully enough for me to consider making it standalone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Textalogue is currently on hold indefinitely due to time constraints, 
                            but I consider the time working with Unity's internal components valuable enough to mention as a project.
                        </p>

                            <li>node-based UI functionality for easier visualisation</li>
                            <li>dialogue choices leading to separate dialogue paths</li>
                            <li>dialogue "warps" allowing for repeated sections or continuous conversation</li>
                            <li>custom text color and scroll speed, alongside the ability to mark text as unskippable</li>
                            <li>fully-customisable drag-and-drop textbox prefab working inside Unity's Canvas element</li>
                            <li>support for setting variables to custom values in-editor and through code to track previous decisions</li>
                            <li>event systems, allowing use of Unity Events mid-dialogue (Textalogue can also wait for an event to complete before continuing)</li>
